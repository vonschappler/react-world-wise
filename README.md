# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


 # Aditional notes about the preview:

1. Due to the use of the json-server package, some of the functionalities where changed to use the local storage instead of the json-server package, so the online preview works fine.
1. A locally fully functional version, with a fake connection to a server, where the **fetch** is used to manage basic CRUD data operations can be found [here](https://github.com/vonschappler/Ultimate-React/tree/main/Section_19/03-world-wise).
